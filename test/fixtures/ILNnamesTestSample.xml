<p>Advices from Philadelphia state that the fibre of the plant
hibiscos moscheutos is occupying the attention of the merchants at
that port as a substitute for linen rags and jute. This plant is
indigenous to the Northern States, and grows in abundance in the
swampy lands of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, &amp;c. At a moderate
calculation, and taking into account the probability of loss from
unforeseen causes, three tons and a half of disentegrated fibre can be
derived from one acre of ground. Two prominent paper manufacturers of
New York have estimated the fibre to be worth 100 dollars per ton, to
be used as a substitute for linen rags in the manufacture of paper.--

<head>[Literature]</head>
<p>We have before us another work which is also peculiarly suited to
the moment. It is written by Mr. D. W. Mitchell, an Englishman who has
been a resident in Richmond, Virginia, and is entitled <hi rend="italic">Ten Years in
the United States. Being an Englishman's View of Men and Things in the
North and South</hi> (Smith and Elder). The author states his object to be
to explain, if possible, the most active and powerful causes of the
great revolution which has taken place in the country in which he
lived, working for his livelihood, and, at the same time, observing
human nature as developed in Americans and American politics. The
residence of Mr. Mitchell in the States commenced in 1848, that year
of European convulsions; and he states with confidence that he has
better opportunity than common of observing and understanding the
people of whom he has written, their habits and feelings, their
private and public life, and believes himself capable of pointing out
the causes of the split between North and South, not the less because he,
with some few others, had marked their rise and progress, and
reflected upon the tendency of the life, political and social, of the
United States. The author declares that, in considering and explaining
the facts which he has here collected, he had to abandon many
preconceived ideas and theories of his own, formed before he went to
the States; and he admits that it is more than probable that some of
the statements he has put forth will conflict with the prejudices and
principles of many of his readers; but he protests that he has written
carefully and conscientiously, with a desire to arrive at the truth as
to the right and wrong of the momentous struggle now going on, sinking
for the time sectarian and party prepossessions. The conclusion to
which he arrives is that the separation of the North and South are not
only natural but desirable; that it therefore inevitably follows, as a
matter of course, he does not hesitate to add, that true liberty and
real progress will suffer no drawback from such a change. There will
probably be those who, in learning these premonitory confessions of a
writer on this vexed question, who has been almost a citizen of the
Southern capital too, will at once conclude that he is a writer in the
Confederate interest purely. Well, perhaps he is so, but to a great
extent unconsciously, if not unavoidably; and if his work is taken up
with just so much qualification as is implied in these two
circumstances of avowal of opinion on the broad question and local
tendencies, we think, on the whole, that it will be found to have
dealt with the case as nearly fairly and impartially as
possible. Apart from the political disquisitions which the volume
contains, there is a good deal of characteristic local colouring. The
plan of the book is founded on the notion of endeavouring, as far as
possible, to let the people of the United States describe themselves,
and to let the parties and factions state their own views; and we are
informed that many remarks and reflections which are not printed as
quotations may be taken to be the deliberate opinions of enlightened
Americans, expressed in conversations and discussions at times when
hackneyed professions of party were for the hour forgotten. It should
be observed that the work contains sketches of life and manners,
social and political, at Richmond, at Washington, and at New York
mainly, and some chapters are devoted to somewhat remote--for
America--history, from which deductions are drawn and brought to bear
on modern and immediate circumstances. Even if it had no other merit,
the earlier chapters, which do something for raising the close veil
which now envelopes the South, its inhabitants, and their ways, would
make this book acceptable; but we venture to think that, as a whole,
it is a contribution of some value to the knowledge of the United
States of America, which most of us are glad to come across at this
particular juncture.</p></div2>

<div2 xml:id="iln42.1184.002" n="The Alabama had Played a Bold Trick" type="Article">
<head>[The Alabama had Played a Bold Trick]</head>
<p>The Alabama had played a bold trick. On the 7th of December she
intercepted the New York and Aspinwall steamer Ariel, off the east end
of Cuba, and took from her 9000 dols. The Ariel was then allowed to
proceed on bonds for 228,000 being given, payable thirty days after
the recognition of the Southern Confederacy. The result of this
proceeding was that on the return voyage the Ariel did not bring the
specie from Aspinwall, and the Federal Government had sent a
war-steamer to fetch it. The West India mail brings us further
intelligence of the doings of the Alabama. Captain Semmes had captured
an American barque, laden with provisions, and after having taken on
board his own ship so much of her cargo as he deemed necessary, he set
fire to the vessel. He had also seized a Federal schooner, but as her
cargo was the property of British subjects she was allowed to proceed
upon the Captain signing a bond to pay a certain sum of money to the
Confederate Government at the close of the war.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Career of the Alabama.</hi>--(To the
Editor.)--Will you grant me space to correct a few of the many errors
contained in Mr. S. M. Underhill's communication to the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>
referring to the Confederate steamer Alabama, a copy of which appeared
in your columns on Saturday last? 1. She was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> built under contract
with a Mr. Butcher. 2. Her engines are not by Penn, of London, but by
Laird, of Birkenhead. 3. She did not, after leaving Birkenhead, steam
directly to the island to the Atlantic, &amp;c., but passed a day and two
nights in Moelfra Bay, on the coast of Wales, taking in there a
portion of her crew, bonded stores, &amp;c. 4. Her destination was not
"Tarissa," wherever that may be, but Terceira, one of the
Azores. 5. She was never commanded by a Captain Bullock. The gentleman
who took charge of her from the time she left the stocks till she was
delivered into the hands of Captain Semmes, of the Confederate navy,
was Captain M. J. Butcher, R.N.R.  6. The Alabama had no English papers
to prove her neutrality; in fact, she carried no papers
whatever. 7. She was not visited daily by large parties of the
inhabitants of "Tarissa," or Terceira. Once only (on the 22nd of
August) a party of about seventy persons, chiefly officials, paid
the vessel a visit.--A.B., Hull, Jan. 12, 1863.</p></div2>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> says:--"Two nephews of
the distinguished Hungarian Governor Kossuth, who have been serving in
the army of Italy for the last two yeas, have arrived in this city,
intending to offer their services in any capacity to the Government of
the United States in its contest with the rebellion.  A son of
